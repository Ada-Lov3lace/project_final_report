    "The purpose of this project is to apply what we have learned in this course to a real-world problem, and assist Frank Wood's research group in the Computer Science department with their recruitment efforts. Specifically, our groups Research Question is targetted towards answering the First of their Three Broad Questions of Interest posed to us, as follows:\n",
    "\"**Question 1:** *What player characteristics and behaviours are most predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter, and how do these features differ between various player types?\"(\"Project Planning Stage: Individual\")*\n",
